# text-readability-vscode README

This extension adds functionality from the [text-readability](https://github.com/clearnote01/readability) library into VSCode

I am using this as a learning area for playing around VSCode extension development. Do not rely on this for production work.

## Features

* Provides commands for different complexity scales provided by the `text-readability` library
* Allows select complexity scales to be added as status bar items
* Provides tree viewer that will show all complexity scales for the currently active editor

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Initial release. Base functionality with commands.
